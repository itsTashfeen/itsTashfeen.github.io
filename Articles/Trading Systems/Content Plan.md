# Content Plan: "Building My First Quant Trading Strategy" Blog Series

This document outlines the content strategy for a series of in-depth articles that will document the development of a quantitative trading strategy from idea to execution. The series will follow the structured phases of a professional quant research project, providing a real-world narrative for readers.

## Series Overview

*   **Total Initial Articles Planned:** 12
*   **Focus:** The process, methodology, and learnings of building a trading bot, not financial advice.
*   **Structure:** The series is divided into phases, with each article covering a specific, logical step in the roadmap.

## Phase 0: The Idea and the Litmus Test (4 Articles)

This phase is all about the "why" and "if" before the "how." It's about professional due diligence and ensuring the project is built on a solid foundation.

### Article 1: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 1 - Before the First Line of Code

**Content:** This article will introduce the project and the core idea. It will cover the entirety of sub-phase 0.1, focusing on the crucial groundwork: Why Polymarket? What does the academic literature say about market efficiency? And who am I competing against? This sets the stage with professional due diligence.

### Article 2: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 2 - A Napkin Sketch of Profitability

**Content:** This article gets hands-on with a small, manageable dataset. It will cover the core of sub-phase 0.2: collecting a sample, running a simple pricing model in a spreadsheet or notebook, and doing a "back-of-the-envelope" calculation to see if a potential profit even exists after realistic costs.

### Article 3: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 3 - The Reality Check: Liquidity and Market Impact

**Content:** A deep dive into a topic that kills most retail strategies. This article will focus on the final part of sub-phase 0.2: analyzing order book data to answer the questions: "Can I actually execute my trades at the size I want?" and "Will my own trades move the price against me?"

### Article 4: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 4 - The Go/No-Go Decision (Phase 0 Complete)

**Content:** This article will summarize the findings from the first three parts. It will present the final analysis from sub-phase 0.3, lay out the success criteria, and formally make the "Go" decision to proceed to the next phase, explaining exactly why the project is worth pursuing.

## Phase 1: From Raw Data to a Proven Edge (8 Articles)

This is the technical core of the project. We'll break this down into more granular articles to cover the complexity in sufficient detail.

### Article 5: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 5 - Building the Foundation: A Systematic's Data Pipeline

**Content:** Covers sub-phase 1.1. A technical guide on setting up the database (TimescaleDB), designing the schema, and building the Python scripts to reliably ingest, clean, and store terabytes of historical market data.

### Article 6: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 6 - Choosing Our Weapons: An Overview of Pricing Models

**Content:** This article introduces the theoretical side of sub-phase 1.2. It will explain the different modeling approaches we'll test: the baseline Black-Scholes model, the more advanced Jump-Diffusion model, and the primary strategy of a direct machine learning classification model.

### Article 7: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 7 - The Art and Science of Feature Engineering

**Content:** A deep dive into the most creative part of the modeling process, covering the "Feature Engineering" section of sub-phase 1.2. This will detail the different categories of features (price, volatility, microstructure) and the rationale behind creating them.

### Article 8: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 8 - Taming the Hydra: Managing a High-Dimensional Feature Space

**Content:** This article tackles the critically important sub-phase 1.3. It will explain why having 100+ features can be dangerous (overfitting) and demonstrate the techniques used to manage this complexity, such as L1 regularization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Article 9: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 9 - Building a Realistic Backtesting Engine

**Content:** This article will focus on the core engineering challenge of sub-phase 1.4: building the simulator itself. It will explain the event-driven structure and the importance of vectorization for speed.

### Article 10: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 10 - The Devil's in the Details: Simulating Costs, Slippage, and Bias

**Content:** This article covers the most important part of backtesting: realism. It will detail the "Advanced Backtesting Features" from sub-phase 1.4, explaining how to model transaction costs, prevent look-ahead bias, and simulate fill probability.

### Article 11: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 11 - Is It Alpha or Just Luck? Statistically Validating the Strategy

**Content:** This article focuses on the statistical rigor from the end of sub-phase 1.4 and 1.5. It will explain advanced techniques like Monte Carlo permutation testing and Walk-Forward Analysis to prove the results are not a fluke.

### Article 12: My First Systematic Strategy, Part 12 - The Moment of Truth: Out-of-Sample Results (Phase 1 Complete)

**Content:** The climax of Phase 1. This article will present the final, validated backtesting results on a never-before-seen holdout dataset. It will show the final equity curve, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown, summarizing the proven edge before moving on to live paper trading.
